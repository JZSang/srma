# Development of Prompt Templates for Large Language Model–Driven Screening in Systematic Reviews


We aimed to develop generic prompt templates for LLM-driven SR abstract (‘Abstract ScreenPrompt’) and full-text screening (‘ISO-ScreenPrompt’) that could be used by future investigators conducting new SRs. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the prompt templates using BenchSR, our newly created database of published SRs.

We found that LLMs have excellent performance in abstract (weighted sensitivity 97.7% [range, 86.7% to 100%], specificity 85.2% [68.3% to 95.9%] and full-text screening (weighted sensitivity 96.5% [89.7% to 100.0%], (91.2% [range, 80.7% to 100%]), rivaling that of human reviewers.
